# OOPSBannerApp
OOPS Banner App - Object-Oriented Programming Learning Project

## UC1 - BannerApp → PrintOOPS - 16.02.2026

+ Build a simple Java application to master the basics.
+ Print OOPS Banner in the Console using print/println function of the IOStream.
+ Produce a single line output.

## UC2 - BannerApp → PrintBanner - 16.02.2026

+ Update UC1 to print OOPS as a banner instead of single line output.
+ Use print/println function of the IOStream to achieve the same.
+ Extend a basic user story by adding visual presentation to a simple message output.

## UC3 - BannerApp → StringJoin - 17.02.2026

+ Update UC2 to use String.join() method instead of IOStream functions only.
+ Same result is obtained as the previous use case but using different methods.

## UC4 - BannerApp → ArrayLoop - 17.02.2026

+ Update UC3 to add loops and display the OOPS Banner.
+ Store every line as a String in a String array.
+ Use for-each loop to iterate through the array and print the banner.

## UC5 - BannerApp → ArrayInit - 18.02.2026

+ Update UC4 by internally initialzing the array.
+ Initialize the String array and assign elements using the .join() method.
+ Use for-each loop to iterate through the array and print the banner.

## UC6 - BannerApp → StaticFunction - 18.02.2026

+ Update UC5 by using static functions.
+ Make a static function to return an individual letter pattern.
+ Call those static functions in the main method and iterate through them to print the banner.

## UC7 - BannerApp → InnerClass - 19.02.2026

+ Update UC6 by contructing an inner class.
+ Create an inner class and construct an object of that class to execute the required function.
+ Get a letter and a String array as arguments to the functions and use a display method to print the banner.

## UC8 - BannerApp → MapCollection - 20.02.2026

+ Update UC7 by creating a HashMap.
+ Map each letter to its respective pattern in the banner and store it in the HashMap.
+ Create a displayMap function and call it in the main method to print the banner via the HashMap.
