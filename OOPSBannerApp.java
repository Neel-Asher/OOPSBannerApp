/**
* OOPSBannerApp UC2 – Banner Display Application
* 
* This class demonstrates the creation of a visual banner displaying the word "OOPS"
* using ASCII art composed of asterisks (*) and spaces. The banner is printed to the
* console using individual print statements for each line, creating a decorativ
* text effect.
*
* We are using internal initializaation of array to achieve this
*
* The banner is generated by printing predefined string patterns line by line
* where each line contributes to forming the letters O, O, P, and S in a stylized format.
* This extends a basic user story by adding visual presentation to a simple message output.
